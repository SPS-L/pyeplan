PyEPLAN is a [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) toolbox for designing resilient mini-grids in developing countries. The initial development was funded under the UKRI GCRF project [CRESUM-HYRES](https://cera.leeds.ac.uk/cresum-hyres/) at the [University of Leeds](https://leeds.ac.uk/), but is now supported and co-developed by people in different universities (such as [CUT](https://sps.cut.ac.cy), [ICL](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/)).
