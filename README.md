[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyeplan.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyeplan) [![image](https://img.shields.io/github/license/apetros/pyeplan)](LICENSE.txt) [![image](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3894705.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3894705)

PyEPLAN is a [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) toolbox for designing resilient mini-grids in developing countries. The initial development was funded under the UKRI GCRF project [CRESUM-HYRES](https://cera.leeds.ac.uk/cresum-hyres/) at the [University of Leeds](https://leeds.ac.uk/), but is now supported and co-developed by people in different universities (such as [CUT](https://sps.cut.ac.cy), [ICL](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/)).
