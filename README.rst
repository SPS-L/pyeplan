PyEPLAN is a `free software <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html>`_ toolbox for designing resilient mini-grids in developing countries. The initial development was funded under the UKRI GCRF project `CRESUM-HYRES <https://cera.leeds.ac.uk/cresum-hyres/>`_ at the `University of Leeds <https://leeds.ac.uk/>`_, but is now supported and co-developed by people in different universities (such as `CUT <https://sps.cut.ac.cy>`_, `ICL <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/>`_).
